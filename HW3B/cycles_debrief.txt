2.	2 hours

3.	I started by creating my main method and my tostring method, in order to
	better understand how to access elements in the array. Then, I worked on
	my longest procedure, which is needed for the overhead method. After
	that, I worked on my overhead procedure with pseudocode first then
	implemented it in MARS. I didn't really experience many issues with bugs
	
4.	I did not seek any outside help.

5.	I am not extremely satisfied with how I did my overhead. It took me a lot
	of instructions to calculate the average, which I think maybe could be
	improved.

6.	I am satisfied with the organization of my code. I think it is quite well
	documented and easy to read, for MIPS at least.
	
7.	My code follows the calling conventions to my knowledge. When I call
	overhead, I store $a0 and $ra so I can use them once it has run the
	longest procedure. All of my other procedures are called from main so
	nothing needed to be stored on the stack.
