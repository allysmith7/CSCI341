2.	2 hours

3.	I began by working on a way to determine the initial state by using shifts
	and masking to isolate bits and store them. Then, once that was working, I
	worked on my printing method. Once that was complete, I implemented the
	looping and the updating of the bits in memory.

4.	None.

5.	I feel like my code is very complete and I am satisfied with it. It isn't
	pretty due to the large amount of branches, but I think it is fine.

6.	I am pleased with how I did my printing. Although it is complicated to look
	at from the start, it is fairly organized once you understand it.

7.	I tested my code mainly by running it and manually checking using the
	printed values that it was working correctly, as well as comparing to the
	examples given.
